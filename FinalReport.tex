% Abstract

\section*{Abstract}
\begin{singlespace}
    \noindent
    This project investigates the performance benefits of parallel and distributed computing techniques applied to two fundamental linear algebra operations:
    LU Decomposition and matrix multiplication. The algorithms are first implemented serially in C++, then enhanced using OpenMP for shared-memory parallelism
    and MPI for distributed computing. To provide a broader comparison, both serial and parallel versions of the same algorithms are also implemented in Rust.
    Performance benchmarks across varying matrix sizes are used to evaluate speedup, scalability, and efficiency within each approach.
    The results provide insight into the comparative strengths of C++ and Rust for high-performance scientific computing, and the effectiveness of OpenMP and
    MPI for parallelizing computationally intensive tasks.
